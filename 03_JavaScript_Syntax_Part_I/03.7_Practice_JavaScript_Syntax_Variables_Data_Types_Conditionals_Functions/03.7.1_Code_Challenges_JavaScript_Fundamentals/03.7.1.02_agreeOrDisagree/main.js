// Write your function here:
function agreeOrDisagree(myOpinion, yourOpinion) {
    if (myOpinion === yourOpinion) {
        return "You agree!";
    } else {
        return "You disagree!";
    }
}

// Uncomment the line below when you're ready to try out your function
console.log(agreeOrDisagree("yep", "yep")) 
// Should print 'You agree!'

// We encourage you to add more function call of your own to test your code!
